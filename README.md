# UGA-Terry-FinTech-Class-Fall-2025.github.io

This is the class website and dynamic roster, which is intended to introduce students to:
* CI/CD basics
* Git as a source-management system
* Using Git and GitHub to release changes to a live application.


Students add themselves to this roster by:
1. creating a new file in `_students/` called {your-name},
2. copying the template into the new file, and
3. updating the template with your information.
