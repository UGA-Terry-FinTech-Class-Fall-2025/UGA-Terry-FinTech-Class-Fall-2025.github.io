# UGA-Terry-FinTech-Class-Fall-2025.github.io

This is the class website and dynamic roster, which is intended to introduce students to:

* CI/CD basics
* Git as a source-management system
* Using Git and GitHub to release changes to a live application.

Students add themselves to this roster by:

1. Fork this repository (click the **Fork** button in the upper right corner of this page),
1. creating a new file in `_students/` called {your-name.md},
1. copying the template text from /templates/bio-template.md (or below) into the new file,
1. updating the template with your information,
1. commiting the change (in GitHub, click **Commit changes** and choose **Create a new branch**),
1. submiting a pull request ( in GitHub click **Propose changes** → **Open pull request**).

That’s it! We’ll review and merge. Your bio will appear in the roster *after* we merge your PR into the repository.

## Tips

* Your new **file name** must start with `_students/` and end with `.md`.

* Keep it short & professional.
* Optional: set `headshot` to an image URL, such as <https://github.com/username.png>.  (A square works best).
* Optional: Use AI to generate a professional headshot. Simply give ChatGPT, or similar, a picture of you and ask it to generate the professional headshot. You can upload your new, professional headshot to the *images* folder, and display your picture by changing the headshot: variable to "*images/image-name.png*".
